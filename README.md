<img src="https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/12075069?s=200&v=4" width="150" height="150" align="left" style="padding:10px;"/> caMicroscope is a digital pathology image viewer with support for human/machine generated annotations and markups. The source code of the caMicroscope project can be found at https://github.com/camicroscope/caMicroscope, released with BSD 3-Clause License. In addition to the caMicroscope project, caMicroscope as an organization also hosts several related tools and products at https://github.com/camicroscope/

For 2022, GSOC projects may be either full-time or half-time. Most project ideas could work in either format, albeit with different levels of scope. Contributors should specifically propose either a full-time or half-time project timeline, and adjust the scope accordingly. We look forward to sharing our thoughts going forward, and thank you for your patience.

# Communicating with the mentors
We intend to use Slack as the primary medium of communication. The slack room at camicroscope.slack.com is used to discuss project ideas. You may join the caMicroscope Slack channel through our shared link - http://bit.ly/camicroscope

# Code Challenges
Code Challenges submissions should demonstrate creativity, understanding of the project, and ability to execute on a project proposal. Submit code challenges for early review and feedback here: [caMicroscope | GSOC 2021 | code challenge submission](https://forms.gle/k4ZcH75UYG4y2tRJ7) 
 
# List of Ideas
The following ideas were created with feedback from contributors and collaborators. Project ideas are not listed in any particular order. Submissions need not come from the below list, but should have reasonable relevance to the caMicroscope organization and its goals. Please feel free to discuss these or other project ideas on the email list or Slack group.

# Applying for GSOC

Mentors and evaluators usually look for:
* The proposal itself is clear relevant, and realistic.
* The contrubutor has demonstrated that they have the relevant skills to complete the proposal.
* The contrubutor has shown an interest in open source, especially caMicroscope. This includes community involvement.
* Code Challenges and other relevant demonstrations go above and beyond in some interesting way.
