**[1] Machine Learning and Region of Interest Extraction**

**Mentors:**  Ryan Birmingham (rbirmin -at- emory.edu)

**Overview:** caMicroscope is a Cancer Digital Pathology exploration and annotation tool.

This project would involve extending the existing machine learning intergrations beyond marking up images, and allow users to fetch regions of interest from a given slide automatically. This would allow for users and scientists to train other models for tasks such as synthetic data generation. 

**Current Status:** Currently, caMicroscope supports uses of multiple types of models for markup, implemented with TensorFlow-JS.

**Required Skills:** Javascript, TensorFlow-JS (recommended)

**Code Challenge:** Using a machine learning toolkit of your choice, create a tool which returns positions in pixels of areas depicting something (e.g. faces).
